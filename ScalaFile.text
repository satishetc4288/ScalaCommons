Scala definitions

Unit class:=> It's subype of AnyVal.It has just one value () which is not a object, It basically copies void concept from java.
Null class:=> Its subtype of AnyRef.it has just one value null. It is used by JVM for null references.
Nothing class:=> its subtype of any other type(even Null).It sits on lowest level of scala class hirarchie. When a function throws a
exception this function essentially represents nothing as return type.
Nil object:=> List[Nothing] equals Nil. It basically represents empty list.
None object: Option[Nothing] equals None.
